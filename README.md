The Ember.js framework and [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com) make a pretty slick team for powering a user-friendly search experience. This modest starter "library" should help you get there. 

Note: the release version corresponds to the version of Ember Data.

**TODO**:    
- [ ] Wrap all this dope ass code into a CLI addon for silky smooth implementations.
- [ ] Migrate to Ember 2.0.
